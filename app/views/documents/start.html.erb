<h2>Goal</h2>
Your goal is to find the item (document / concept) you're shown using the search and browsing capability of the system. Since finding the item you've just seen is too easy, we show <%= @display_page_total %> items in a row and tell you which item to find in the end. <br><br>

There are two different scenarios of finding in this game, which is decided by the system at random for each target item. 

<ul>
	<li>Finding a document </li> You're asked to find the target <u>document</u> using search or browsing into related item.
	<li>Finding a concept (entity, term, etc.)</li> You're asked to find the target <u>concept</u> by browsing into relevant concept starting from one of entry points.
</ul>

For each search / browsing activity, you'll see a rank list of relevant items. Your score is determined by where in the rank list you can locate the target item. For instance, if the target item was found at the first rank, you can get 10 points.<br>

<h2>Rules</h2>
- You'll be finding <%= @pages_per_game %> items per game, each of which will be provided with <%= @display_page_total-1 %> other items. <br>

- You'll be given <%= @queries_per_page%> trial. Each <u>keyword</u> you type in or click to the relevant item is counted as one trial.<br>

- You'll be given <%= @time_per_page %> seconds to skim each item after it's loaded.<br><br>

- After scoring more than 50, you get a higher level and enjoy more challenging game. <br>

- Before your first query or click for each item, you can skip to the next item without penalty.<br>

- Please do not use copy and paste text. (pasting to search box is disabled) <br>
